Stylebook lets you explore and shop for clothing collections.

Built at the Myntra Hackathon - 25th April 2015, Bangalore.

# Demo

# Tech

This app is a great example of using React Native and Parse to have a really fast development platform. React Native gives you the ability to use Javascript to write your application while still rendering native elements. Parse gives you a backend, API and clients all abstracted away and provided free.
